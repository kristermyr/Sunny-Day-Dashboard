# Sunny-Day-Dashboard

## Description
Sunny-Day-Dashboard some of my newly learned skills working with Javascript, jquery and API's . I have learned an introduction in how you can pull information from a API and use it on a website, in different locations using different methods. 
While This page is not the most efficient, I believe that found a good solution to get where I wanted to be...almost. The error that I would like to have corrected are to have created buttons based on the users input that linked back to what was searched. 


## Installation
Website URL: https://kristermyr.github.io/Sunny-Day-Dashboard/
Open Github: https://github.com/kristermyr/Sunny-Day-Dashboard.git

## Usage

The following acceptance criteria has been completed: 
```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
```
![Sunny-Day-Dashboard contains a simplistic designed start page with a input field and a search button. The user types the name of the city they would like to see the weather to and hits search and are shown the current weather and a 5-day forecast. ](./assets/img/Screenshot%202022-12-05%20164932.png)
